## Side interests

Although not a main focus of my professional activities, I always try to keep learning new things.

I've made a GitHub client for `Android` which, unfortunately, I've been unable to finish for now...

I'm currently learning `Go` and made some contact with `Docker`, `PostreSQL` and `RabbitMQ`.
