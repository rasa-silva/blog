## About

Software Engineer with 13 years of experience in back-end applications with a passion for clean architecture and readable code.

Currently a member of the software architecture team for a <acronym title="Software Defined Networking">SDN</acronym> distributed system controlling optical networks.

I'm constantly trying to improve my craft and love discovering new technologies and development approaches.
