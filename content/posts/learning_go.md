I've been trying to learn golang recently for a couple of reasons:
- I like learning new stuff
- I'm seeing a big demand for golang
- I'm getting annoyed with the JVM "ecosystem"

The first two points are, I think, self-explanatory.

The last one deserves some considerations:

I'm not annoyed with the JVM itself, in fact, I find it fascinating.
I love simplicity. It's one of the main traits I look for in the code I write and many other aspects of my life. It will be a recurring theme in this blog...
In my day-to-day I constantly experiment...a new lib, some new bit of code, etc...
The fact that, in golang, I can create a directory with a file `main.go` and start coding has a zen quality to it.
Contrast that with the Java/Scala/Kotlin that practically forces me to do a Maven/Gradle project for simply trying a new lib...



Some links I found useful on my gopherization process:

- https://golang.org/doc/faq

I good amount of answers about design, usage, etc.

- https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html

First page to read after learning the syntax.

- https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#repository-structure

A great post about how to structure files and packages.
There's also a couple of links to related articles that expand on the topic.
