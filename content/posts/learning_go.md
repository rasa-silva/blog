I've been learning golang recently for a couple of reasons.


### I like learning new stuff

### I'm getting annoyed with the JVM "ecosystem"

I love simplicity. It will probably be a recurring theme in this blog...

It's one of the main traits I strive for in the code I write and that I look for in the code I read. 

In my day-to-day work I constantly experiment...a new lib, some new bit of code, etc...

The fact that, in Go, I can create a directory with `main.go` and start coding, has a zen quality to it.
Contrast that with the Java/Scala/Kotlin that practically forces me to do a Maven/Gradle project for simply trying a new lib...
I'm not annoyed with the JVM itself, in fact, I find it fascinating.



### Some links I found useful on my _gopherization_ process

- https://golang.org/doc/faq

I good amount of answers about design, usage, etc.

- https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html

First page to read after learning the syntax.

- https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#repository-structure

A great post about how to structure files and packages.
There's also a couple of links to related articles that expand on the topic.

Like the URL states, learn by example.
