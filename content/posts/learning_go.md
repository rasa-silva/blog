Being a software engineer by profession, I find weird that some of my peers don't seem to have any interest in discovery and improvement.
Now, I'm definitely not one for going home after an 8hr work day, and spend 4 more hours coding some side-project.
I have a wife, 2 daughters and other interests in life besides software engineering...
But for the life of me, I can't understand how some software engineers don't seem to find one bit interesting when a new language comes out.
When a new tool drops on GitHub. When a new trend emerges...

It's fun discovering a new programming language when something comes up on HackerNews.
That said, I don't have enough time to explore a new language a month that, while interesting from a PLT point-of-view, I'm going to have to use something like notepad++ to program with...

Current workplace is a Java only place that I've somehow managed to sneak Kotlin in...
Granted that's kinda cheating since, going from Java to Kotlin, is a 1 month operation to any decent Java programmer...

Don't get me wrong, Kotlin is a much, **much** improved version of Java. The fact that one can switch with that time frame only attests to the quality of the operation that JetBrains has going on.

But it's still JVM based. It's still Maven/Gradle. It's still hybrid Structured/OO/Functional. And there's nothing wrong with it...but, for a software engineer, same-old same-old should not be something that one lives with...

Enter Go.

Simple and fast to learn, good tooling, structured only, no VM, interesting projects and some job prospects...

Let's Go!


### Some links I'm finding useful on my _gopherization_ process

- https://golang.org/doc/faq

I good amount of answers about design, usage, etc.

- https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html

First page to read after learning the syntax.

Thoughts on how to structure files and packages.
